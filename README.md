Names of functions, constants are mostly those of Kitronik-Pico-Robotics-Board-MicroPython

Restrictions: only motors will be controlled in this first version

Kitronik Robotics board is designed to use a Raspberry Pi Pico module, but any microcontroller module 
with an I2C interface can be used (test done on Arduino Nano 33 BLE).
